while i am trying to create VM from CLI command, it is throwing error on image what i have used. Despite i have used different image names to do so. But had same error below. Could you please look into it.

Error :
This user name 'admin' meets general requirements, but specifically disallowed for this image. Please try a different value.

Thanks
